While Suvidha enhances Express.js with type safety and structure, it has some intentional trade-offs:

### 1. **TypeScript Required**
   - Designed for TypeScript. Pure JavaScript projects won’t benefit from type inference or validation.

---

### 2. **Zod Dependency**
   - Relies on Zod for validation. Alternative libraries (Joi, Yup) aren’t natively supported.

---

### 3. **Global Middleware Compatibility**
   - Express global middleware (e.g., `app.use(cors())`) won’t extend Suvidha’s typed context.

---

### 4. **Response Control**
   - Mixing `res.send()` and Suvidha’s `Http` classes can trigger dual-response warnings.
   - Prefer returning data or throwing errors instead of manual response handling.

---

### 5. **Custom Handlers Require Boilerplate**
   - To use `Http` classes or `Protocol` objects in custom handlers, you must implement:
     ```ts
     interface Handlers {
       onComplete(output: unknown, conn: Conn): void;
       // ...other methods
     }
     ```

---

### 8. **Learning Curve**
   - Requires understanding of Zod, type chaining, and Suvidha’s flow (vs raw Express).

---

**Why These Trade-Offs?**  
Suvidha prioritizes **type safety** and **predictable flow** over flexibility. It’s ideal for teams valuing strict contracts over Express’s "anything goes" approach.
