While Suvidha enhances Express.js with type safety and structure, it has some trade-offs:

### 1. **TypeScript Required**

- Designed for TypeScript. Pure JavaScript projects will not benefit from type inference or validation.

---

### 2. **Zod Dependency**

- Relies on Zod for validation. Alternative libraries such as Joi and Yup are not natively supported yet.

---

### 3. **Global Middleware Compatibility**

- Express global middleware (e.g., `app.use(cors())`) won’t extend Suvidha’s typed context.

---

### 4. Shallow Immutability in Middleware

Suvidha enforces **shallow readonly** constraints on context objects. Although root-level keys are immutable, nested objects can still be modified:

```ts
.use(() => ({
  user: { name: "Alice" } // root key "user" is readonly
}))

// Root-level mutation is blocked.
req.context.user = { name: "Bob" }; // TypeScript error

// Nested mutation allowed (risky!)
req.context.user.name = "Bob"; // No error, but this violates the intended immutability.
```

---

### 5. **Response Control**

- Mixing `res.send()` with Suvidha’s `Http` classes can trigger dual-response warnings.
- It is recommended to return data or throw errors rather than manually handling responses.

---

### 6. **Custom Handlers Require Boilerplate**

- To use `Http` classes or `Protocol` objects in custom handlers, you need to implement the `Handlers` interface.

---

### 7. **Learning Curve**

- Requires an understanding of Zod, type chaining, and Suvidha’s flow compared to raw Express.
